# Github User Search App

This is a project built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript.

In this project you can search any github username and get the stats such as their profile picture, bio, date of joining, number of repositories, followers and following count, their location, twitter username, portfolio and company associated with it.
If no such user is there in github it will show the message accordingly.
The default github stats shown on page load belongs to the developer of the page.
